### Today's Code Challenge!
This is a two-part challenge.


**Part One:**
+ Create an array called `favorite_movies` that holds your ten favorite movies (Each movie should be a string).
+ Iterate over the array using `.each` to print out `#{movie} is one of my favorites!`
+ Return the number of items in the array.
+ Return the first item in the array
+ Return the last item in the array

**Part Two:**
+ Create a hash called `favorite_music` where the key is the title of the song, and the value is the songâ€™s artist. Make sure your hash has at least five key-value pairs.
+ Iterate through the hash to return a string for each key value pair that reads `I love #{song} by #{artist}!`
+ Return the number of key-value pairs in your hash.
